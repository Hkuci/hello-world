# hello-world
This is my first time that i am using GitHub.

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. 

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
